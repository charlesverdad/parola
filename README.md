# Parola Project

Parola is a mobile-friendly file server for the raspberry pi. Based on the Bible box project (insert link here), Parola aims to provide educational materials to groups of people (Seafarers, in particular) that may have no internet access for long periods of time. 

Although our team recommends materials that will help users in important aspects of their life - relationships, leadership, spiritual, financial, etc - it is up to the admin to download these files and include their own if they wish. Files can be stored in a flash drive and will be automatically categorized and served by Parola once it is inserted into the device.

Parola also has a built-in Bible. In the future, support for curriculum-making (for follow-up series, etc.) will be included.
